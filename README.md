# Privacy Cargo Tracking with FHE

A revolutionary blockchain-based logistics tracking system that leverages Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) to provide unprecedented privacy and security for cargo shipments. This application demonstrates how sensitive logistics data can be kept confidential while still maintaining transparency and traceability.

## üîê Core Concepts

### Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) Contracts
Our system utilizes cutting-edge FHE technology powered by Zama's FHEVM, enabling computations on encrypted data without ever revealing the underlying information. This means:

- **Encrypted Priority Levels**: Cargo priority (standard, expedited, urgent, critical) remains hidden
- **Protected Value Information**: Shipment values are encrypted and never exposed
- **Confidential Fragile Status**: Whether items are fragile stays private
- **Secure Access Control**: Only authorized parties can decrypt specific data

### Privacy-First Cargo Tracking
Traditional logistics systems expose sensitive information to multiple parties. Our FHE-powered solution ensures:

- **Selective Transparency**: Owners control what information is public vs private
- **Encrypted Computations**: Processing happens on encrypted data directly
- **Zero-Knowledge Verification**: Verify cargo status without revealing details
- **Granular Permissions**: Fine-tuned access control for different stakeholders

### Confidential Logistics Tracking
The application provides enterprise-grade privacy features:

- **Private Tracking IDs**: Cargo identifiers can be kept confidential
- **Encrypted Location Data**: Current positions protected by FHE
- **Secure Status Updates**: Status changes maintain privacy throughout the supply chain
- **Authorized Viewer System**: Grant specific parties limited access without full disclosure
